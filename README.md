# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Medical Health Record System for managing patients records using Blockchain. It comes with a MHR contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
